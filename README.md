Hi, I'm Yash

I'm studying Computer Science at USC, graduating in December 2023.

Coursework: 
1. CSCI570 - Analysis of Algorithms
2. CSCI571 - Web Technologies
3. CSCI402 - Operating Systems
4. CSCI450 - Computer Networks
5. CSCI572 - Multimedia Systems
6. CSCI585 - Database Systems

I am motivated by the opportunities to leverage automation in day-to-day life. Be it something as simple as a folder management system to something as complex as investments and portfolio management. I am deeply enthusiastic about leveraging developer APIs and building something meaningful out of it.
If not with APIs, web scraping always provides a convenient alternative to achieve a similar outcome. 
For example, I leveraged the Splitwise API to retrieve expenses and built a smart expense categorization tool using Levenshtein Distance (edit distance) algorithm. 

I combine my vocation and avocation by building custom dashboards for stalking stocks (Screener), tracking expenses (Splitwise), monitoring price fluctuations of wishlisted items on Amazon (good ol' web scraping), pulling up random liked tweets from Twitter (API), etc. all using Developer APIs or Web Scraping.

Projects: 
1. Investments Manager:
  Scraped fundamental ratios and media releases from stocks analysis websites with BeautifulSoup library to assess growth trajectory and signal buy opportunities
  Fetched historical data from YahooFinance to enable trend analysis using moving averages algorithm, used Chart.js to visualize price trend and correlation by sector.

2. Interactive Video Exploration (Spring 2023)
  Developed an interactive video exploration tool which indexes given video into scenes, shots and subshots using Shannon Entropy and OpenCV’s Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) algorithm with 93% accuracy; developed frontend using PyQT5
  
3. Operating Systems (Fall 2022)
  Simulated a traffic shaper that services packets controlled by a token-bucket filter, using multithreading 
  Implemented kernel process and thread management subsystem with scheduling and synchronization mechanisms, virtual memory subsystem to handle page faults for user processes with copy-on-write feature
