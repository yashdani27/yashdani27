Hi, I'm Yash

I'm studying Computer Science at USC, expected to graduate by December 2023.
Coursework: 
1. CSCI570 - Analysis of Algorithms
2. CSCI571 - Web Technologies
3. CSCI402 - Operating Systems
4. CSCI450 - Computer Networks

I am motivated by the opportunities to leverage automation in day-to-day life. Be it something as simple as a folder management system to something as complex as investments and portfolio management. I am deeply enthusiastic about leveraging developer APIs provided by almost every tech giant today and building something meaningful out of it.
If not with APIs, web scraping always provides a convenient alternative to achieve a similar outcome. 

I combine my vocation and avocation by building custom dashboards for stalking stocks (Screener), tracking expenses (Splitwise), monitoring price fluctuations of wishlisted items on Amazon (good ol' web scraping), pulling up random liked tweets from Twitter (API), etc. all using Developer APIs or Web Scraping.

Projects: 
1. Stock Analysis Engine
•	Scraped fundamental ratios and media releases from stocks analysis websites with BeautifulSoup library to assess growth trajectory and signal buy opportunities
•	Fetched historical data from YahooFinance to enable trend analysis using moving averages algorithm, used Chart.js to visualize price trend and correlation by sector.

2. Amazon Goodreads Price trend Analyzer
•	Developed a program to periodically fetch book prices and ratings from Amazon and Goodreads, using Python’s Scrapy library, notifying, and assisting users to make better buying decisions
